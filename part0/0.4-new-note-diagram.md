    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: Upon user pressing submit button, the browser submits the HTTP POST request and there is a payload included in the request which consists of the form data which can be processed by the server-side code.  Server responds to the browser with HTTP "302 found" status code; this is a URL redirect and the server sends response headers including the "location" key with value "/exampleapp/notes" for the redirect request.   

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: This is the redirect to the location which was provided in the response headers after the above POST request.

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser:  the existence of a link tag with relation of stylesheet and src in the header of the notes html document instructs the browser to fetch the css file located at the src address

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The script tag in the head of the notes html document instructs the browser to fetch  the .js file located at the src address.  The browser then starts executing the javaScript code in that file, in this case using the XMLHttpRequest API to fetch JSON from the server, using open() and send() to accomplish this.

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: when the xhttp object changes as a result of open() and send(), the browser executes the callback function assigned to onreadystatechange.  With readyState == 4 and statuscode of 200, the callback function renders the notes as a list.   if the statuscode is not 200 or readystate is not 4, there is no additional code run in this function and it will return undefined as there is no explicit return statement.
